13) class---> data along with the functions.
                template occupy no memory
14)object---> instance of the class.
                to create we need the reference variable ,new keyword and the construnctor.
                for reference variable the memory is allocated in stack like the( type,hashcode).
                the ojects will be stored in the heap and it has some hashcode.
15) what is the instance variable?
Instance variables, also known as instance fields or member variables, 
are variables defined within a class but outside of any method or constructor. 
    they are initialized by default we can acess directly.
16)we need to create the object if we want to acess the non static method with the static method.
17) constructor-----------same name as class,no return type,called only when object is created.
    get invoked first.
    constuctor overloading ----multiple methods with different parameters.
    TODO: constructor chaining.
          construcot chaining.
18)static--------non acess modifier which is used for the variable and the methods.
        from the instance method we can use any methods which may be static or not.
        but from the static method to acess non static we need to create the object to acess them.
19) method overloading----
    muliple function with same name but withdifferent numbres of argument
    return type may or may not same.
20)this---example


import java.util.*;
class Hari{
    Hari(){
        System.out.println(this);
    }  
    void fun(){

    }
}
class Temp {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Hari obj=new Hari();
        System.out.println(obj);
    }
    
}




-->program 2 copy the data


import java.util.*;
class Hari{
    int a;
    int b;
    Hari(){

    }
    Hari(int x,int y){
        this.a=x;
        this.b=y;

    }

    void copy(Hari o){
        o.a=this.a;
        o.b=this.b;

    }
}
class Temp {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Hari o=new Hari(4,5);
        Hari o2=new Hari();
        o.copy(o2);
        System.out.println(o2.a+" "+o2.b);

    }
    
}




Inheritance----------------------------->
Has a Relation


import java.util.*;
class Hari{
    int b=10;
}
class shyam{

    Hari obj1=new Hari();
}
class Temp {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        shyam obj2=new shyam();
        System.out.println(obj2.obj1.b);

    }
    
}



println-----------(class)printStream
System-------------->(package).lang

System.out.pritln()   ?
