Topic:- DataTypes

There are two main categories of data types:
   - primitive types and reference types.
   Note :- 1 Byte = 8 Bits

1. Primitive types: (8 types)
   - boolean: (true or false) : 1 Bit.
   - byte: 8-bit :1 Byte .
   - short: 16 bit :2 Bytes.
   - int: 32 bit: 4 Bytes.
   - long: 64 bit: 8 Bytes.
   - float: single-precision: 32 bit: 4 bytes
      float=0.5f;
   - double: double-precision : 64-bit : 8 Bytes
   - char:  16-bit : 2 bytes.

2. Reference types:
   - Class types: These are created using classes defined by the programmer or provided by Java libraries.
   - Array types: These are used to hold multiple values of the same type in a contiguous block of memory.
   - Interface types: These define a contract for classes implementing them.
   - Enum types: These represent a fixed set of constants.
   - Null type: Represents the absence of a value or a reference that does not refer to any object.
