Topic:- History of java 

    > Java is an "Object Oriented Programming Language" and also an "High Level Language".
    > Java was Developed by the "James Gosling".In Sun Micro System.
    > Initially java was named as Oak. Later they changed to the java due to the patent issue.
    > Java was officially developed in the year 1995.
    > write Once,compile Once,Run anywhere

Topic:- Platform (or) Edition 

    > Standard Edition
        - For desktop applications.
        - eg:-Antivirus,Media Player.

    > Java Enterprise Edition (J2EE)
        - For building the "web application".

    > Java Micro Edition 
        -To develop the mobile Edition

Note:- 
    1) Is java is compiled or the Interpreted?

        - Java is both the compiled and the Interpreted language to make it platform independent.

    2)what is JDK,JRE,JVM?
    
    > JDK ( Java development and includes the tools and libraries needed to write and compile Java code )

    Theory:- 

        - JDK (Java Development Kit): The JDK is a software development kit that includes all the tools necessary for developing Java applications. 
    
        - It contains the Java compiler (javac), which is used to compile Java source code into bytecode. 
    
        - The JDK also includes other development tools, such as the debugger (jdb), documentation generator (javadoc), and various utility programs. 
    
        - It provides libraries and APIs that developers can use to build Java applications.
    
        In summary, the JDK is used by developers to write, compile, and debug Java code.

    > JRE ( The JRE is used for running Java applications and provides the necessary runtime environment )
    
    Theory:-

        - JRE (Java Runtime Environment): The JRE is a runtime environment that is needed to run Java applications.
    
        - It includes the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and the Java class libraries. When you install the JRE, you get everything needed to run Java programs.

        - but you don't have the development tools like the compiler and debugger. 

        - The JRE is used by end users who want to run Java applications on their systems. It provides the necessary runtime support for executing Java bytecode.
    
    > JVM (JVM is the component within the JRE that interprets and executes Java bytecode.)

    Theory:-

        - JVM (Java Virtual Machine): The JVM is a virtual machine that executes Java bytecode.

        - The JVM is responsible for 
            1. interpreting the bytecode
            2. managing memory
            3. providing runtime services such as automatic garbage collection.
            It abstracts the underlying hardware and operating system.

        - allowing Java programs to be executed in a platform-independent manner. 

        - The JVM translates the bytecode into machine code that can be     understood  by the specific system it is running on. 

        The JVM is a key factor in enabling Java's "write once, run anywhere" principle.

    - System.out.println();
