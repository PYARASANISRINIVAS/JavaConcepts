    There are two type of converstion
    -> Implicit conversion / Widening
    -> Explicit conversion / Narrowing

> Implicit conversion 

    The Automatic conversion is possible only if two conditions are met
        - Two types are compatible.
        - The destination type is larger than source type.
        - converting a smaller type to a larger type size

        - byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double

> Explicit conversion

    - If Automatic conversion is not possible.Then we will use the Manual conversion.
    - To create the conversion between two Incompatible types.
        Syntax:- (target-type)value.

    - double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte
    
    Example:- byte b;
              int i=257;
              double d=323.142;
              b=(byte)i;
              b=(byte)d;
              i=(int)d;
