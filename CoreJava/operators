Topic:- Operator

1. Arithmetic Operators:
   Arithmetic operators perform mathematical calculations on numeric operands.

   - Addition: `+`
   - Subtraction: `-`
   - Multiplication: `*`
   - Division: `/`
   - Modulus (remainder): `%`
   - Increment: `++`
   - Decrement: `--`

2. Assignment Operators:
   Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

   - Assignment: `=`
   - Addition assignment: `+=`
   - Subtraction assignment: `-=`
   - Multiplication assignment: `*=`
   - Division assignment: `/=`
   - Modulus assignment: `%=`

3. Comparison Operators:
   Comparison operators are used to compare values and determine the relationship between them. They return a boolean result (`true` or `false`).

   - Equal to: `==`
   - Not equal to: `!=`
   - Greater than: `>`
   - Less than: `<`
   - Greater than or equal to: `>=`
   - Less than or equal to: `<=`

4. Logical Operators:
   Logical operators are used to perform logical operations on boolean expressions.

   - Logical AND: `&&`
   - Logical OR: `||`
   - Logical NOT: `!`

5. Bitwise Operators:
   Bitwise operators perform operations on individual bits of binary representations of operands.

   - Bitwise AND: `&`
   - Bitwise OR: `|`
   - Bitwise XOR (exclusive OR): `^`
   - Bitwise NOT: `~`
   - Left shift: `<<`
   - Right shift: `>>`
   - Unsigned right shift: `>>>`

6. Ternary Operator:
   The ternary operator (`?:`) is a shorthand conditional operator that evaluates a condition and returns one of two expressions based on the result.

   
   condition ? expression1 : expression2
   

7. Instanceof Operator:
   The `instanceof` operator checks if an object is an instance of a specific class or implements a specific interface.

  
   object instanceof ClassName
